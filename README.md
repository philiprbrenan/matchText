# MatchText

![Test](https://github.com/philiprbrenan/matchText/workflows/Test/badge.svg)

Match the text of a question against a database of possible answers and return
the most plausible response.

Try for yourself by forking this repo and modifying file: **questions.txt** to
add more questions, file: **answers.txt** to add more answers. Commit the
results and wait for the GitHub Action to run to see the most plausible answer
to each question in file **results.txt**!
